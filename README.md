#Sam's Blog
This is [my]() attempt at an ongoing personal blog where I could pick my branins out and make sense of of the senseless.

## Tech used

###Jekyll
Add jekyll links here
### Hyde

Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
