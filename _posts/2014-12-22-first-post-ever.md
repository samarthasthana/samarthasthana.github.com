title: First post ever

This is an interesting transition that me and my blog have decided to go through. Before this we had tried
wordpress, which gave so many options that I was always confused about what I really wanted. Rails was always an option
but it would require hardwork setting things up. Obviously the 'hardwork' we are talking about is negligible when
compared to any other tech stack, but I am a true 'Slob' when it comes to doing work that requires me cutting down
my free time.

So [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is for people like me. It a framework thats one step ahead of Rails. It not just up, it up and running and
down three laps from the word go!

Now I hope that I would be able to keep picking my mind and blogging about my life now that I can use [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) and
[github markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) and not bother about hosting as [Github](https://pages.github.com/) is the kidest deployment manager ever. Wish me luck!!
